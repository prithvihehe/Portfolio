    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Prithvi Dutta</span>, a driven student at IIT BHU with a passion for coding, designing, and the field of quant. My involvement in organizing events and holding leadership roles, such as being a designer for the Technex fest and a marketing coordinator for Kashiyatra, has taught me valuable skills in project management and teamwork.<br><br>

I'm always eager to learn and explore new things, driven by my curiosity and desire to expand my skillset. As a student guide at the SCS council, I'm able to share my knowledge and experience with others while continuing to learn and grow.<br><br>

My skills include coding, designing, and project management, and I aspire to work in the tech industry as a developer or a quant trader. While I haven't decided which path to pursue, I'm confident that my passion for learning and experimenting will help me succeed in either field.</p>
